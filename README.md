# Small picture host webside created with create-next-app

Small website using next and react that allows you to upload picture and then share it by id and password.
It's not really safe and honestly was created only to show my friend how much data can be extracted from simple picture they took with their phone.
It wont work in serverless infrastructure as it saves pictures in local file system also some kind of encryption on those wouldn't hurt.
Needs more work to be used even as private server to share pictures with friends when security isnt really a concern
